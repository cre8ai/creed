# Welcome to Cre8ai

**Cre8ai is a global alliance of creators who believe in the ethical use of AI in art, writing, code, and design.**

We are writers, artists, coders, designers, filmmakers, and dreamers who use AI as a tool—not a crutch.  
We protect authorship. We honour originality. We defend creative integrity.
