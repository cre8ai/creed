The Cre8ai.og Creator's Movement Manifesto
# Cre8ai: A Global Alliance of Creators for the Ethical Use of AI

**We are writers, artists, coders, designers, and dreamers who believe that artificial intelligence should not replace the human voice—it should amplify it.**

Cre8ai exists to protect the integrity, dignity, and authorship of creators in an age where automation is easy, but originality is rare.

This repository contains:
- Our living **Creed**
- Our **Creative Commons-licensed badge kit**
- Our **manifesto** (short + long form)
- A roadmap for tools, templates, and community resources

We are building a quiet revolution—one word, one brushstroke, one keystroke at a time.

**All creators are welcome. Use the badge. Share the creed. Be counted.**

*This is just the beginning.*
